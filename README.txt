## Project Overview
The **MARC Rover Simulation** is a C-based program that simulates the navigation of an autonomous rover named MARC across a grid-like map. The project focuses on pathfinding, cost optimization, and terrain traversal, making it an educational tool for understanding algorithms and simulation systems.

---

## Goals
1. **Simulate Autonomous Navigation**:
   - MARC navigates a grid while minimizing traversal costs based on terrain types.

2. **Pathfinding Optimization**:
   - Use a tree-based approach to explore and simulate various paths.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Provide an interface for users to interact with the simulation by selecting starting positions, viewing detailed outputs, and more.

## How to Use

### Simulation Options
- **Option 1**: Simulate the full path with detailed output.
- **Option 2**: Simulate the full path with a summary only.
- **Option 3**: Display the map with costs.
- **Option 4**: Exit the program.

### Interactive Features
- You can now:
  - **Choose MARC's starting position**.
